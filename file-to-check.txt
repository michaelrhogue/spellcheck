Code Challenges

We want to see code you've written. Some people don't have open source or freely available code they can share, so we have some short code challenges you can do. You can pick from INTERSECTION.md or SPELL_CHECK.md.

Use whatever language and tech stack you're most comfortable with.

Please try to spend between two and four hours on this. This is to protect you; we don't want you to spend days coding only for either one of us to decide later we aren't a good fit for each other. It isn't a hard cutoff. If you want to spend more time on it that is fine, but don't feel pressure to spend more time.

Just like in real life, you can use the internet to help you remember some syntax or figure out a library. Unlike real life, you should not use someone else's solution for the coding challenge. Use good judgement. Googling how to read in a file is fine. Googling "how does a spell-checker work" to get a basic idea of an algorithm is fine. Copying and pasting a spell-checker you've found online is not fine.

The goal isn't to finish the assignment (though we won't complain if you do!). The goal is to see how you approach a problem. Can you decide on and implement an algorithm? What data structures do you use? How do you organize your code? What parts of the problem seem most important to solve first?

Please contact us if anything in the instructions is confusing. We've tried to leave space for creativity and problem-solving, but we also don't want you becoming frustrated or stuck.

Good luck!
